I'm a PhD student at University of British Columbia and my supervisor is [Vered Shwartz](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~vshwartz/). 

My research focuses on improving the reasoning capabilities of multimodal models by integrating extra-linguistic contexts through transparent and controllable processes. 
My ultimate goal is to develop a reliable multimodal AI assistant that enhances human decision-making and serves as a valuable tool, without replacing human agency.

Before starting a PhD, I primarily worked with members at [Information Extraction and Synthesis Laboratory (IESL)](http://www.iesl.cs.umass.edu/) and IBM Research while receiving a MS in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.
I also spent some time in industry, I worked for Naver in Knowledge Base team for about a year before starting PhD program, 
and I worked for IBM as an application developer for a year before starting Master's program.
